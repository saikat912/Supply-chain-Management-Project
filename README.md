## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`SupplyChain_model.ipynb`) that demonstrates data-driven approaches to supply chain modeling. The project aims to help users understand and optimize supply chain operations by leveraging Python’s data science ecosystem.

## Features

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling for supply chain optimization
- Visualization of key metrics and results
- Easily extensible for custom datasets and scenarios

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supplychain-model.git
   cd supplychain-model
   ```

2. **Set up a Python environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *If `requirements.txt` is not provided, ensure you have:*
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn
   - jupyter

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `SupplyChain_model.ipynb` to get started.

## Usage

- Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.
- Replace the sample data with your own supply chain dataset if desired.
- Modify and extend the code to fit your specific modeling needs.
